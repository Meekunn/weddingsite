						"From the moment I met you, I knew that you were special. Your smile, your laugh, your kindness, and your compassion all drew me to you like a magnet. And as I got to know you better, I realized that you are not just a special person, but you are the person I want to spend the rest of my life with. You have brought so much joy into my life, and I want to share that joy with you forever.
						<br />
						I want to wake up every morning knowing that I am blessed to have you by my side.<br />
						I want to experience life's adventures with you,<br />
						explore the world with you,<br />
						build a family with you,<br />
						face life's challenges together,<br />
						triumph together,<br />
						support you in all your dreams and aspirations,<br />
						and create memories that will last a lifetime. <br />

All mentioned above could have been enough, then I remember the book of 1 Cor 13 made it clear that, if all do all, but I have not loved, itâ€™s all void.
Hence, I want to love you with all my heart, every day for the rest of my life."
